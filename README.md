## Introduction

With rising costs of gasoline and crude oil prices hitting all-time highs, understanding the drivers of this market is a question well suited for regression analysis. This project aims to uncover major correlates of historical oil prices (and therefore gasoline prices) to understand the current market in 2022. Additionally, due to the large amount of data and data sources available, this project also aims to experiment with, explore, and apply a machine learning algorithm known as Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS).
